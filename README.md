(Old project)  Answers to the first two chapters of [The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_start), from last summer when I was getting serious about learning programming.  It rocked my world, but I was using a different version of lisp and lacked the sysadmin skills to get the picture language section working.

If you're starting out with sicp, you're in for a treat.  Three pieces of advice:

1.  Don't read other people's answers until you've hacked something together on your own.
2.  Do read other people's answers once you've hacked something together on your own.  Mine are most certainly not the best out there.
3.  Skip the picture language section.  I've since read that a lot of people ran into difficulties there, and the consensus seems to be that its value/annoyance ratio is much lower than the rest of the book.
